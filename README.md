# Mouse & Keyboard-Controlled Game

A simple 2D browser-based game where you control a mouse-shaped character using keyboard and mouse inputs. Collect coins, avoid obstacles, and level up!

- **Gameplay**: Collect gold coins for points, avoid red obstacles that reduce health. Game over when health reaches 0.
